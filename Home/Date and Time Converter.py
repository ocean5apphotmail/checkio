#  Computer date and time format consists only of numbers, for example: 21.05.2018 16:30
# Humans prefer to see something like this: 21 May 2018 year, 16 hours 30 minutes
# Your task is simple - convert the input date and time from computer format into a "human" format.
#
# example
#
# Input: Date and time as a string
#
# Output: The same date and time, but in a more readable format
#
# Example:
# date_time("01.01.2000 00:00") == "1 January 2000 year 0 hours 0 minutes"
# date_time("19.09.2999 01:59") == "19 September 2999 year 1 hour 59 minutes"
# date_time("21.10.1999 18:01") == "21 October 1999 year 18 hours 1 minute"
# # NB: words "hour" and "minute" are to be used only when time is 01:mm (1 hour) or hh:01 (1 minute).
# # In other cases "hours" and "minutes" should be used.
#  How it is used: To improve the understanding between computers and humans.
#
# Precondition :
# 0 < day <= 31
# 0 < month <= 12
# 0 < year <= 3000
# 0 <= hours < 24
# 0 <= minutes < 60
