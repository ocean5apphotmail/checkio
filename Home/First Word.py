#  You are given a string where you have to find its first word.
#
# When solving a task pay attention to the following points:
#
#     There can be dots and commas in a string.
#     A string can start with a letter or, for example, a dot or space.
#     A word can contain an apostrophe and it's a part of a word.
#     The whole text can be represented with one word and that's it.
#
# Input: A string.
#
# Output: A string.
#
# Example:
#
# first_word("Hello world") == "Hello"
# first_word("greetings, friends") == "greetings"
#  How it is used: the first word is a command in a command line
#
# Precondition: the text can contain a-z A-Z , . '
